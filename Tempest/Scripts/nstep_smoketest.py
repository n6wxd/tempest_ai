"""
Quick smoke tests for NStepReplayBuffer without requiring the full training stack.
Validates:
- Discounted n-step return R_n computation
- Horizon (steps_used) values
- Actor boundary split (no cross-actor aggregation)
- Terminal flush behavior (no transitions lost on done)

Run: python Scripts/nstep_smoketest.py
Expected: All tests print PASS with computed values.
